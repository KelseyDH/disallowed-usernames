# Disallowed Usernames
A CSV file containing a list of words which should be ignored from your username database.

## What

An open source database of dis-allowed usernames for startups.

The goal of this project is to create a universal database of disallowed usernames for web applications. 

## Why

For example, you don't want someone to sign-up with the username titled `support` or `administrator`.

And depending on your setup, they could probably generate something like:

http://example.com/support

or

http://support.example.com

and use this to send out emails impersonating as someone un-suspecting from your application.

## How

You can also import this file directly from your database's GUI (like phpMyAdmin, Sequel Pro, HeidiSQL).
